    <section class="section-content">
        <h2>1. Fried Chicken: The Heart of Al Baik</h2>
        <h3>Why It’s a Classic</h3>
        <p>There’s a reason <strong>fried chicken</strong> is often called the heart of Al Baik’s menu. As soon as you step into any of their locations, you’ll be greeted by the unmistakable sight of golden fried chicken stacked high, waiting to be devoured. When I first tried it, I knew I was in for something special. The crispy coating crunches perfectly with every bite, revealing the juicy, tender chicken inside. This isn’t just fried chicken – this is <strong>Al Baik fried chicken</strong>.</p>
        <h3>What Makes It So Special</h3>
        <p>The secret to Al Baik’s fried chicken isn’t just in the cooking technique but in the spices and seasoning. They’ve perfected the blend of <strong>paprika</strong>, <strong>garlic</strong>, and <strong>cayenne pepper</strong> that gives each piece a mouth-watering kick. The crunchy exterior doesn’t overpower the meat but complements it, creating that perfect balance. This dish is, without a doubt, what draws people back again and again.</p>

        <h2>2. Broasted Chicken: Al Baik’s Signature Twist</h2>
        <h3>A Different Kind of Fried</h3>
        <p>Now, if you’ve had fried chicken, you’ve probably heard of <strong>broasted chicken</strong>, a method where the chicken is pressure-cooked and then fried. At Al Baik, <strong>broasted chicken</strong> is another one of those dishes that’s hard to top. I remember trying it for the first time and thinking it couldn’t get any better than this. It’s like the fried chicken you know and love, but with an extra twist – juicier, more tender, and every bit as crispy as you want it to be.</p>
        <h3>The Broasting Method</h3>
        <p>The beauty of <strong>broasted chicken</strong> lies in its cooking method. The chicken is cooked under pressure, which locks in moisture, keeping the meat super tender. Then, it’s fried to perfection, giving you that signature crunch. For those who like their chicken juicy and crispy, this is the dish to go for.</p>
